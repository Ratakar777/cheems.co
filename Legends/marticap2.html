    <p>It all started with this tweet:</p>

    <p>Tiago the jeets asking below one of Cheems tweets what would it take to reach 100 million marticap, his goal was
      to write marketcap but, as a Cheems community member, he is retarded, like most of us.</p>

    <p>Little did he know that this was the start of something greater, the community loved this word:</p>

    <p>Over time, "marticap" has come to symbolize a significant issue within the Cheems community. Initially just a
      term, its meaning has evolved to represent a manipulated marketcap, where a large portion of the supply is snipped
      at launch by developers, creating a skewed chart. In an industry where VCs often use this tactic to pump various
      memecoins risk-free, Cheems stands out with its genuinely decentralized supply and market cap.</p>
