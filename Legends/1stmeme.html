    <p>Yes, even Magic Eden follows us. In fact, it goes beyond that. We were among the first partners of Magic Eden,
      supporting them when they had fewer than 2,000 followers on Twitter, long before their launch.</p>

    <p>Cheems has been part of this ecosystem longer than most. When we launched, NFTs weren’t even a concept on
      Solana—the
      technology simply didn't exist. That's how longstanding Cheems is. We've been driving this ecosystem
      forward with deep love and passion.</p>
