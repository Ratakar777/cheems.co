    <p>Once upon a time, a character known as Firecrab ventured into our Discord, harboring big dreams of making a mark
      in the crypto world. Full of curiosity, he inquired about CHEEMS, but his journey was fraught with challenges.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The Discord was overrun with trolls who didn't like the bad vibe Firecrab was transmitting, inebriated folks,
      and people too absorbed in their dealings to care. Amidst
      this chaos, Firecrab faced not only indifference but also direct insults from the community members.</p>
    <p>Disheartened, he got kicked from the group, but not before delivering a prophecy that would echo across the
      globe, carried on the lips of countless witnesses:</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
      <a href="https://twitter.com/firecrab_/status/1453577827417219075">October 29, 2021</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This incident led to CHEEMS being dubbed the most toxic community of 2021 on Solana.</p>
    <p>Became a copy pasta

    </p>
    <p>He even became a card in Cheems Arena

    </p>
    <p>Since then, the Cheems community is no longer considered the most toxic community on Solana. The community has
      matured and likes to jokingly call itself "the most retarded community."</p>
