  <div class="story-content">
    <p>Taking inspiration from the world-famous meme <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/swole-doge-vs-cheems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"swole doge vs cheems"</a>, this video was initially created as a joke
      with no real intention to actually make a memecoin. However, it blew up on Twitter.

    <p>On May 10, 2021, SatoCheems posted the video, sent it to his friends, and directly went to sleep. He thought it
      would just make his friends laugh, but no. He woke up with 10K new followers on Twitter and 700K views on the
      video. Everyone was dead serious and wanted a Cheems airdrop. He found himself bombarded with messages, all asking
      when Cheems would be released. With no other option, SatoCheems had to turn the joke into a reality.
    </p>

    <p>So, on May 12, 2021, when Solana was still new, SatoCheems decided to go for it. He gave away 85% of $CHEEMS to
      early supporters in a big airdrop to over 6,000+ people. Little did they know, they were starting something big—a
      memecoin all about the community. And that's how $CHEEMS began.
