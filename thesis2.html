    <h2 id="why-real-memes-matter-for-memecoins">Why Real Memes Matter for Memecoins</h2>
    <p>Cheems, Doge, and Pepe memes big deal for memecoins cuz they really make people laugh.</p>
    <p>Other memes, like the ones made with big vc money in Web3, not same. They not real internet stuff, feel like
      someone trying too hard.</p>
    <p>CRINGE AF<br>NOT FUNNY.<br>WHERE IS THE MEME????</p>
    <p>Memecoins with real memes do better. People know them, feel connected. Not just about money, but about culture
      too.</p>
    <p>WE CARE ABOUT CULTURE!!!</p>
    <p>Real memes keep memecoins going strong. They stick around, part of internet culture.</p>
    <p>Fake memes can't do that.</p>
